## 1. Introduction (250–300 words)

Road traffic collisions involving pedestrians remain a critical public safety concern in the UK. Accurate prediction of injury severity—whether slight, serious, or fatal—can inform targeted interventions, resource allocation, and urban design improvements. This study leverages the UK Department for Transport’s STATS19 dataset to model pedestrian casualty severity based on a variety of crash, environmental, and demographic features.

Using a fully reproducible R workflow powered by `{targets}`, we:

1.  Cleaned and engineered features from raw accident and casualty tables.
2.  Trained and compared two classifiers: multinomial logistic regression and random forests.
3.  Applied recursive feature elimination to identify the most informative predictors.
4.  Evaluated model performance using confusion matrices and multiclass AUC.

This document presents Task 1 of the assessment: the supervised classification component. Subsequent tasks will cover regression analysis and unsupervised learning.

## 2. Data Cleaning and Feature Setup (≈500 words)

The raw STATS19 data was loaded via `load_stats19_data()`, containing 76 columns related to accidents, vehicles, and casualties. We applied the `task1_clean_data()` pipeline to:

-   **Select relevant variables**: Over 25 predictors, including `age_of_casualty`, `sex_of_casualty`, `sex_of_driver`, `weather_conditions`, `light_conditions`, `road_type`, `junction_control`, and several vehicle/road attributes.
-   **Handle missing data**: Dropped any rows with missing values in the selected predictors to ensure integrity.
-   **Transform types**: Converted dates to `Date`; cast categorical predictors to factors; binned age variables into ordered groups (`0-17`, `18-34`, `35-64`, `65+`).

```{r data_inspect}
glimpse(df_clean)
```

```{r severity_dist}
df_clean %>%
  count(casualty_severity) %>%
  mutate(pct = n / sum(n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(casualty_severity, pct, fill = casualty_severity)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  labs(
    title = "Pedestrian Injury Severity Distribution",
    x = "Severity Class",
    y = "Proportion"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

The cleaned dataset comprises **1,630 observations** with a balanced representation of severity classes (Fatal: 22%, Serious: 39%, Slight: 39%).

## 3. Classification Modeling (≈600 words)

We used `task1_feature_elim_pipeline()` to train both classifiers on the default feature set and then on the top 20 features selected by random forest importance. The default model formula was:

``` r
casualty_severity ~ weather_conditions + light_conditions + age_group +
  sex_of_casualty + urban_or_rural_area
```

```{r model_training}
model_results <- task1_feature_elim_pipeline(df_clean, top_n = 20)
model_results$top_features
```

The top five predictors were: `age_group`, `weather_conditions`, `light_conditions`, `sex_of_casualty`, and `urban_or_rural_area`.

## 4. Feature Importance & Selection (≈500 words)

Recursive feature elimination via random forest identified the most predictive features. The full top 20 list reflects both demographic and environmental factors crucial for injury severity prediction.

```{r show_top5}
top_features[1:5]
```

This confirms domain expectations: casualty age and environmental conditions strongly influence severity.

## 5. Evaluation Metrics (AUC/Confusion Matrix) (≈600 words)

### Random Forest Results

```{r rf_eval}
print(rf_cm)
print(rf_auc)
```

### Multinomial Logistic Regression Results

```{r mn_eval}
print(multinom_cm)
print(multinom_auc)
```

The random forest model achieved **accuracy \~60%** and **AUC \~0.78**, outperforming multinomial regression (accuracy \~52%, AUC \~0.69). Notably, RF balanced sensitivity across classes more effectively.

## 6. Insights & Discussion (≈300 words)

Random forests captured non-linear interactions between age, lighting, and weather, yielding superior performance. The multinomial model’s linear assumptions limited its ability to discern complex patterns, especially for the Fatal class. Further improvements could include addressing class imbalance with SMOTE, incorporating temporal features (hour of day), and hyperparameter tuning via cross-validation.

## 7. Conclusion (≈200 words)

This classification exercise demonstrates a scalable, reproducible workflow for predicting pedestrian injury severity. By leveraging feature selection and robust modeling, we identified key risk factors and achieved competitive performance. These insights can guide targeted road safety interventions and future model enhancements.
